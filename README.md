# Honeypot-Implementation-in-Cloud-Environ-with-Open-Source-Medium

## Introduction üîî
Honeypots can provide a valuable cybersecurity information. But is it worth the risk? A network-attached machine called a honeypot is set up as a ruse and is intended to mimic a server or other high-value asset. Its goal is to stop hacking efforts that may have otherwise resulted in illegal access to information systems. A honeypot service typically consists of a machine, apps, and    records that mimic the deviance of such a profound system such a banking system or IoT devices but are entirely isolated and closely watched.

## Objective üôÑ

The foregoing are the research objectives for the study:
- The perspective is to find solutions to issues with security, the use of honeypots, and the volume of data we can gather.
- Examine the rules that apply to honeypot installation constraints, as well as how far a network security administrator can go to gather data and find the hacker, with a focus on India.
- Need to provide explanations and generate some discussion about what should be done in accordance with the law and what shouldn't.
